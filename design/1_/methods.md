The methodology of the pilot experiment is exactly identical to that of Experiment 1a, except on the following points.

# Subjects
Three subjects were tested. Subjects BM and MD were authors, subject ES was not naive. All three are also participants in the main experiment. We do not remember who exactly is subject 1, 2, and 3.

# Conditions and structure
Twelve contour density levels were used, for a total of 2x2x2x12 conditions and 2x2x2x12x100 = 9600 trials. However, the subjects only completed 1000, 1000 and 800 trials before analysis was performed.

A practice experiment of 240 trials was run before the actual experiment, just like in Experiment 1a. In the first block, levels 1-3 were used, in the next two levels 1-5+12, and in the last two levels 1-12.

# Stimuli
The twelve contour density levels were chosen as follows:  
* Low background: 23.5  
* Low random contour: 16.5000   17.7727   19.0455   20.3182   21.5909   22.8636   24.1364   25.4091   26.6818   27.9545   29.2273   30.5000  
* Low equidistant contour: 18.5000   19.7727   21.0455   22.3182   23.5909   24.8636   26.1364   27.4091   28.6818   29.9545   31.2273   32.5000  
* High background: 16.5  
* High random contour: 11.5000   12.4091   13.3182   14.2273   15.1364   16.0455   16.9545   17.8636   18.7727   19.6818   20.5909   21.5000  
* High equidistant contour: 13.5000   14.4091   15.3182   16.2273   17.1364   18.0455   18.9545   19.8636   20.7727   21.6818   22.5909   23.5000  

Note that this also includes several levels were the contour was less dense than the background.

The stimulus generation script is saved (`/experiment/1_`), but the stimuli themselves are not.


# Trial events
A pause of 500ms instead of 200ms was used before each trial start, and fixation duration lasted between 500 and 1000ms instead of between 200ms and 400ms.

# Analysis
A plot of all curves was made. We chose the final levels, per hi/lo density and ran/eq element placement, to have limited points with a ceiling effect on the left side. On the right side we noted that performance was low. Therefore we would collect only 1 point in a separate experiment, 1b, with explicit instruction to detect sparse contours. The most difficult point was set such that it slightly overshot the null-point of 'contour equals background'. This way, we would cover the whole range of performance, but not too much either.

We limited the number of contour density levels to 8 for Experiment 1a, and 1 for Experiment 1b.

Unfortunately no script or further written information exists on this contour density level selection procedure.
